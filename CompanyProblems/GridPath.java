//Grid Path
//Given a grid. Each cell of the grid contains a single integer value. These values are described by 2D
//integer array a with N rows and 2 columns, where a[i][j] is the value in the cell located in row i,
//column j.
//Standing in (i; j), the player can move to any cell of the next row (i+1; j2) under the condition that
//a[i+1][j2] > a[i][j]. In other words, the value in the next cell of the player's path should be strictly
//greater than the value in the current cell of the player's path.
//The player can't make any moves if he's already in the last row.
//If the player starts in any cell of the first row (either (1; 1) or (1; 2)), what is the maximum possible
//total sum of values in all cells he can visit on his path?
//Print the answer modulo 10^9+7.
//Input:
//The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of rows in a.
//The next line contains an integer, 2, denoting the number of columns in a.
//Each line i of the n subsequent lines (where 0 â‰¤ i < n) contains 2 space separated integers each
//describing the row a[i].
